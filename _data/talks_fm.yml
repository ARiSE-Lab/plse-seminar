      title: "FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness"
      abstract: "Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3× speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4× speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy)."

    - speaker: Ce Zhang (ETH, Together Compute)
      date: W 1/18/23
      abstract: "The rapid progress of machine learning in the last decade has been fueled by the increasing scale of data and compute. Today's training algorithms are often communication heavy, as a result, large-scale models are trained dominantly in a centralized environment such as data centers with fast network connections. This strong dependency on fast interconnections is becoming the limiting factor of further scaling, not only for the data center setting but also for alternative decentralized infrastructures such as spot instances and geo-distributed volunteer computes. In this talk, I will discuss our research in communication-efficient distributed learning and our current effort in training foundation models in a decentralized way."
      bio: "Ce is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. The mission of his research is to make machine learning techniques widely accessible---while being cost-efficient and trustworthy---to everyone who wants to use them to make our world a better place. He believes in a system approach to enabling this goal, and his current research focuses on building next-generation machine learning platforms and systems that are data-centric, human-centric, and declaratively scalable. Before joining ETH, Ce finished his PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and spent another year as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford, both advised by Christopher Ré. His work has received recognitions such as the SIGMOD Best Paper Award, SIGMOD Research Highlight Award, Google Focused Research Award, an ERC Starting Grant, and has been featured and reported by Science, Nature, the Communications of the ACM, and a various media outlets such as Atlantic, WIRED, Quanta Magazine, etc."

    - speaker: Aakanksha Chowdhery (Google Brain)
      date: W 1/25/23
      abstract: "Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, dense Transformer language model at Google, which we refer to as Pathways Language Model (PaLM). In this talk, we discuss the system considerations and model improvements necessary to train the PaLM model across 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways at very high efficiency levels. Next we share how scaling the model to 540B parameters results in state-of-the-art few shot learning results across hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. We will also share some of the more recent works built on top of PaLM that push the SOTA in various domains and democratize access to natural language processing."
      title: "Pathways Language Model and Model Scaling"
      bio: "Aakanksha has led the effort on training large language models at Google Research which led to the 540B PaLM model. Aakanksha has also been a core member of the Pathways project at Google. Prior to joining Google, Aakanksha led interdisciplinary teams at Microsoft Research and Princeton University across machine learning, distributed systems and networking.  Aakanksha completed her PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, and was awarded the Paul Baran Marconi Young Scholar Award for the outstanding scientific contributions in the field of communications and the Internet."
