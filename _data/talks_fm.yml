      title: "FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness"
      abstract: "Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3× speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4× speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy)."

    - speaker: Ce Zhang (ETH, Together Compute)
      date: W 1/18/23
      abstract: "The rapid progress of machine learning in the last decade has been fueled by the increasing scale of data and compute. Today's training algorithms are often communication heavy, as a result, large-scale models are trained dominantly in a centralized environment such as data centers with fast network connections. This strong dependency on fast interconnections is becoming the limiting factor of further scaling, not only for the data center setting but also for alternative decentralized infrastructures such as spot instances and geo-distributed volunteer computes. In this talk, I will discuss our research in communication-efficient distributed learning and our current effort in training foundation models in a decentralized way."
      bio: "Ce is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. The mission of his research is to make machine learning techniques widely accessible---while being cost-efficient and trustworthy---to everyone who wants to use them to make our world a better place. He believes in a system approach to enabling this goal, and his current research focuses on building next-generation machine learning platforms and systems that are data-centric, human-centric, and declaratively scalable. Before joining ETH, Ce finished his PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and spent another year as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford, both advised by Christopher Ré. His work has received recognitions such as the SIGMOD Best Paper Award, SIGMOD Research Highlight Award, Google Focused Research Award, an ERC Starting Grant, and has been featured and reported by Science, Nature, the Communications of the ACM, and a various media outlets such as Atlantic, WIRED, Quanta Magazine, etc."

    - speaker: Aakanksha Chowdhery (Google Brain)
      date: W 1/25/23
      abstract: "Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, dense Transformer language model at Google, which we refer to as Pathways Language Model (PaLM). In this talk, we discuss the system considerations and model improvements necessary to train the PaLM model across 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways at very high efficiency levels. Next we share how scaling the model to 540B parameters results in state-of-the-art few shot learning results across hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. We will also share some of the more recent works built on top of PaLM that push the SOTA in various domains and democratize access to natural language processing."

      title: Mechanistic Interpretability - Reverse Engineering Learned Algorithms from Transformers
      abstract: "Transformers are exceptionally powerful technologies that have quickly gone from smashing NLP benchmarks to being one of, if not the premier ML technology in a wide array of fields. Given their growing role in technological pipelines and society writ large, understanding how and why they work is a pressing issue. In this talk I give an overview of research on Mechanistic Interpretability, a field of work that has had substantial success picking apart transformers and understanding the algorithms that trained models use to reason. Topics covered include: the algorithm that toy LLMs can use to perform arithmetic accurately; how real-world LLMs do object identification; and how AlphaFold learns 2D projections of structures and then inflates them over time. Time permitting, I hope to discuss recent discoveries at EleutherAI currently under review for publication."
      bio: "Stella Biderman is the head of research at EleutherAI, an online research lab that has revolutionized open access to large language models. She is best known for her work on democratizing LLMs, especially the GPT-Neo-2.7B, GPT-NeoX-20B, and BLOOM-176B models, all of which where the largest publicly available GPT-3-style LLMs in the world at time of release. Her work on publicly available datasets and evaluation frameworks has become an integral part of training foundation models in NLP. Her interest in open sourcing NLP models is primarily driven by her passion for interpretability research, a topic she has increasingly focused on as access to LLMs has increased. She proudly does not possess a PhD."

      title: A data-centric view on reliable generalization
      abstract: "Researchers have proposed many methods to make neural networks more reliable under distribution shift, yet there is still large room for improvement. Are better training algorithms or training data the more promising way forward? In this talk, we study this question in the context of computer vision and OpenAI's CLIP model for learning from image-text data. First, we survey the current robustness landscape based on a large-scale experimental study involving more than 200 different models and test conditions. The CLIP models stand out with unprecedented robustness gains on multiple challenging distribution shifts. To further improve CLIP, we then introduce new methods for reliably fine-tuning models by interpolating the weights of multiple models. Finally, we investigate the cause of CLIP's robustness via controlled experiments to disentangle the influence of language supervision and training distribution. While CLIP leveraged large scale language supervision for the first time, its robustness actually comes from the pre-training dataset. Based on our findings, we will conclude with initial experiments to improve the pre-training datasets for image-text models."
