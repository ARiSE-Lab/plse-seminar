      title: "The Hardware Lottery"
      abstract: "I will introduce the term Hardware lottery to describe when a research idea wins because it is suited to the available software and hardware and not because the idea is superior to alternative research directions. This talk will motivate attention to hardware lotteries by discussing examples from early computer history which have delayed research progress by casting successful ideas as failures. These lessons are particularly salient given the advent of domain specialized hardware which make it increasingly costly to stray off of the beaten path of research ideas."
      bio: "Sara Hooker is a researcher at Google Brain working on reliable explanations of model behavior. Her main research interests gravitate towards training models beyond test-set accuracy to be compact, robust, fair and interpretable.

      title: "Chip Floorplanning with Deep Reinforcement Learning"
      abstract: "In this talk, I will describe a reinforcement learning (RL) method for chip floorplanning, the engineering problem of designing the physical layout of a computer chip. Chip floorplanning ordinarily requires weeks or months of effort by physical design engineers to produce manufacturable layouts. Our method generates floorplans in under six hours that are superior or comparable to humans in all key metrics, including power consumption, performance, and chip area. To achieve this, we pose chip floorplanning as a reinforcement learning problem, and develop a novel edge-based graph convolutional neural network architecture capable of learning rich and transferrable representations of the chip. Our method was used in the design of the next generation of Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators (TPU)."

      title: "A missing link in the ML infrastructure stack?"
      abstract: "Machine learning is quickly becoming a product engineering discipline. Although several new categories of infrastructure and tools have emerged to help teams turn their models into production systems, doing so is still extremely challenging for most companies. In this talk, we survey the tooling landscape and point out several parts of the machine learning lifecycle that are still underserved. We propose a new category of tool that could help alleviate these challenges and connect the fragmented production ML tooling ecosystem. We conclude by discussing similarities and differences between our proposed system and those of a few top companies."

      title: "Horovod and the Evolution of Deep Learning at Scale"
      abstract: "Deep neural networks are pushing the state of the art in numerous machine learning research domains; from computer vision, to natural language processing, and even tabular business data.  However, scaling such models to train efficiently on large datasets imposes a unique set of challenges that traditional batch data processing systems were not designed to solve.  Horovod is an open source framework that scales models written in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet to train seamlessly on hundreds of GPUs in parallel.  In this talk, we'll explain the concepts and unique constraints that led to the development of Horovod at Uber, and discuss how the latest trends in deep learning research are informing the future direction of the project within the Linux Foundation.  We'll explore how Horovod fits into production ML workflows in industry, and how tools like Spark and Ray can combine with Horovod to make productionizing deep learning at scale on remote data centers as simple as running locally on your laptop.  Finally, we'll share some thoughts on what's next for large scale deep learning, including new distributed training architectures and how the larger ecosystem of production ML tooling is evolving."

I will first talk about MCUNet that brings deep learning to IoT devices. The technique is tiny neural architecture search (TinyNAS) co-designed with a tiny inference engine (TinyEngine), enabling ImageNet-scale inference on an IoT device with only 1MB of FLASH. Next I will talk about TinyTL that enables on-device training, reducing the memory footprint by 7-13x.  Finally, I will describe Differentiable Augmentation that enables data-efficient GAN training, generating photo-realistic images using only 100 images, which used to require tens of thousand of images. We hope such TinyML techniques can make AI greener, faster, and more sustainable."

      date: 12/10/20
      title: "From Ideas to Video Analysis Models in Hours, Not Weeks"
      abstract: "My students and I often find ourselves as \"subject matter experts\" needing to create video understanding models that serve computer graphics and video analysis applications.  Unfortunately, like many, we are frustrated by how a smart grad student, armed with a large *unlabeled* video collection, an palette of pre-trained models, and an idea of what novel object or activity they want to detect/segment/classify, requires days-to-weeks to create and validate a model for their task.  In this talk I will discuss challenges we've faced in the iterative process of curating data, training models, and validating models for the specific case of rare events and categories in image and video collections.  In this regime we've found that conventional wisdom about training on imbalance data sets, and data acquisition via active learning does not lead to the most efficient solutions.  I'll discuss these challenges in the context of image and video analysis applications, and elaborate on our ongoing vision of how a grad student, armed with massive amounts of unlabeled video data, pretrained models, and available-in-seconds-supercomputing-scale elastic compute should be able to interactively iterate on cycles of acquiring training data, training models, and validating models."

      date: 12/03/20
      title: "Scalable Bayesian Optimization for Industrial Applications"
      abstract: "Bayesian optimization has become a powerful method for the sample-efficient optimization of expensive black-box functions. These functions do not have a closed-form and are evaluated for example by running a complex economic simulation, by an experiment in the lab or in a market, or by a CFD simulation.  Use cases arise in machine learning, e.g., when tuning the configuration of an ML model or when optimizing a reinforcement learning policy.  Examples in engineering include the design of aerodynamic structures or materials discovery.
In this talk I will introduce the key ideas of Bayesian optimization and discuss how they can be applied to tuning ML models.  Moreover, I will share some experiences with developing a Bayesian optimization service in industry.

      title: "JAX: accelerating machine learning research by composing function transformations in Python"
      abstract: "JAX is a system for high-performance machine learning research and numerical computing. It offers the familiarity of Python+NumPy together with hardware acceleration, plus a set of composable function transformations: automatic differentiation, automatic batching, end-to-end compilation (via XLA), parallelizing over multiple accelerators, and more. JAX's core strength is its guarantee that these user-wielded transformations can be composed arbitrarily, so that programmers can write math (e.g. a loss function) and transform it into pieces of an ML program (e.g. a vectorized, compiled, batch gradient function for that loss).

JAX had its open-source release in December 2018 (https://github.com/google/jax). It's used by researchers for a wide range of applications, from studying training dynamics of neural networks, to probabilistic programming, to scientific applications in physics and biology."

    - speaker: Alex Ratner
      date: 11/05/20
      title: "Programmatically Building & Managing Training Data with Snorkel"
      abstract: "One of the key bottlenecks in building machine learning systems is creating and managing the massive training datasets that today's models require. In this talk, I will describe our work on Snorkel (snorkel.org), an open-source framework for building and managing training datasets, and describe three key operators for letting users build and manipulate training datasets: labeling functions, for labeling unlabeled data; transformation functions, for expressing data augmentation strategies; and slicing functions, for partitioning and structuring training datasets.  These operators allow domain expert users to specify machine learning (ML) models entirely via noisy operators over training data, expressed as simple Python functions---or even via higher level NL or point-and-click interfaces---leading to applications that can be built in hours or days, rather than months or years, and that can be iteratively developed, modified, versioned, and audited. I will describe recent work on modeling the noise and imprecision inherent in these operators, and using these approaches to train ML models that solve real-world problems, including recent state-of-the-art results on benchmark tasks and real-world industry, government, and medical deployments."

      date: 10/29/20
      title: "On Heterogeneity in Federated Settings"
      abstract: "A defining characteristic of federated learning is the presence of heterogeneity, i.e., that data and compute may differ significantly across the network. In this talk I show that the challenge of heterogeneity pervades the machine learning process in federated settings, affecting issues such as optimization, modeling, and fairness. In terms of optimization, I discuss FedProx, a distributed optimization method that offers robustness to systems and statistical heterogeneity. I then explore the role that heterogeneity plays in delivering models that are accurate and fair to all users/devices in the network. Our work here extends classical ideas in multi-task learning and alpha-fairness to large-scale heterogeneous networks, enabling flexible, accurate, and fair federated learning."

      date: 10/22/20
      title: "Machine Learning at Industrial Scale: Lessons from the MLflow Project"
      abstract: "Although enterprise adoption of machine learning is still early on, many enterprises in all industries already have hundreds of internal ML applications. ML powers business processes with an impact of hundreds of millions of dollars in industrial IoT, finance, healthcare and retail. Building and operating these applications reliably requires infrastructure that is different from traditional software development, which has led to significant investment in the construction of “ML platforms” specifically designed to run ML applications. In this talk, I’ll discuss some of the common challenges in productionizing ML applications based on experience building MLflow, an open source ML platform started at Databricks. MLflow is now the most widely used open source project in this area, with over 2 million downloads a month and integrations with dozens of other products. I’ll also highlight some interesting problems users face that are not covered deeply in current ML systems research, such as the need for “hands-free” ML that can train thousands of independent models without direct tuning from the ML developer for regulatory reasons, and the impact of privacy and interpretability regulations on ML. All my examples will be based on experience at large Databricks / MLflow customers."
      bio: "Matei Zaharia is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and Chief Technologist at Databricks.
