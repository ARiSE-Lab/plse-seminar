      title: "SafePredict and Friends"
      abstract: "SafePredict is a meta-algorithm for machine learning applications that
strategically refuses to accept the predictions of an underlying machine
learning algorithm or algorithms. The goal is to achieve a
user-specified correctness rate on the non-refused predictions without
refusing too much. We show applications to an on-line learning setting
in which the data-to-class mapping is not independent and identically
distributed (not iid).

In related work, we look at classification problems where we are willing
to guess, on average, k classes in the hopes that one is correct. We
compare such an approach in which we always choose the top k most likely
classes.

Finally, we consider the problem of selective sampling in settings where
evaluating each sample is expensive. We build on and improve the
Horvitz-Thompson and Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted sampling
methods."

      title: "Data-efficient and Robust Learning from Massive Datasets"
      abstract: "Large datasets have been crucial to the success of modern machine learning models. However, training on massive data has two major limitations. First, it is contingent on exceptionally large and expensive computational resources, and incurs a substantial cost due to the significant energy consumption. Second, in many real-world applications such as medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, and fraud detection, big data contains highly imbalanced classes and noisy labels. In such cases, training on the entire data does not result in a high-quality model.  

In this talk, I will argue that we can address the above limitations by developing techniques that can identify and extract the representative subsets for learning from massive datasets. Training on representative subsets not only reduces the substantial costs of learning from big data, but also improves their accuracy and robustness against noisy labels. I will discuss how we can develop theoretically rigorous techniques that provide strong guarantees for the quality of the extracted subsets, as well as the learned models’ quality and robustness against noisy labels. I will also show the effectiveness of such methods in practice for data-efficient and robust learning."

      title: "Towards Transparent Foundations -- Building Accessible Infrastructure for Training Large-Scale Language Models"
      abstract: "“Foundation models” — large-scale self-supervised models that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks - are changing how machine learning systems are constructed and deployed. Due to their extreme resource demands, training and developing a science behind these models has remained difficult. In this talk, I'll introduce and describe the journey behind Mistral, an infrastructure for accessible, easy-to-use foundation model training. I'll describe some of the hurdles we encountered with stable, reproducible training and how we see Mistral as a crucial step to facilitate open foundation model research."

      title: "Distributed ML System for Large-scale Models: Dynamic Distributed Training and Scalable Federated Learning"
      abstract: "In modern AI, large-scale deep learning models have emerged as the core technology behind many important Internet businesses, such as Search/ADs/Recommendation System/CV/NLP. BERT, Vision Transformer, GPT-3, and Switch Transformer models scale up the model size to a billion or even trillion number of parameters, showing non-trivial accuracy improvement for nearly all learning tasks. Distributed training using cloud clusters is key to the successful training of such large-scale models in a timely manner. Developing more advanced distributed training systems and algorithms can either reduce the energy cost or enable us to train even larger models. Furthermore, it is also essential to develop disruptive learning paradigms like federated learning, which can not only protect the privacy of users but also distribute the burden of handling unprecedented big data and models.

This talk will mainly focus on distributed ML systems for large-scale models: dynamic distributed training for the cloud cluster (https://DistML.ai) and scale federated learning for the edge devices (https://FedML.ai). In the first part, I will introduce PipeTransformer, an automated elastic pipelining for distributed training of Transformer models (BERT and ViT). In PipeTransformer, we design an adaptive on the fly freeze algorithm that can identify and freeze some layers gradually during training, and an elastic pipelining system that can dynamically reduce GPU resources to train the remaining active layers, and also forks more pipelines on released GPU resources to enlarge the width of data parallelism. In the second part, I will talk about scalable federated learning towards training large-scale models on resource-constrained edge devices and FedML Ecosystem, which aims at ubiquitously distributed training at the edge for diverse AI applications such as CV NLP, GraphNN, and IoT."

      title: "Scalable, Accurate, Robust Binary Analysis with Transfer Learning"
      abstract: "Binary program analysis is a fundamental building block for a broad
spectrum of security tasks. Essentially, binary analysis encapsulates
a diverse set of tasks that aim to understand and analyze
behaviors/semantics of binary programs. Existing approaches often
tackle each analysis task independently and heavily employ ad-hoc
task-specific brittle heuristics. While recent ML-based approaches
have shown some early promise, they too tend to learn spurious
features and overfit to specific tasks without understanding the
underlying program semantics.

In this talk, I will describe two of our recent projects that use
transfer learning to learn binary program semantics and transfer the
learned knowledge for different binary analysis tasks. Our key
observation is that by designing a pretraining task that can learn
binary code semantics, we can drastically boost the performance of
binary analysis tasks. Our pretraining task is fully self-supervised
-- it does not need expensive labeling effort and therefore can easily
generalize across different architectures, operating systems,
compilers, optimizations, and obfuscations. Extensive experiments show
that our approach drastically improves the performance of popular
tasks like binary disassembly and matching semantically similar binary
functions."

      title: "Beyond Softmax: Scaling Probabilistic Structure in NLP"
      abstract: "Progress on large autoregressive models for NLP applications has been transformative, but has left many practical questions about how to utilize these approaches in a controllable and efficient manner. This talk explores this challenge of using probabilistic models to impose explicit modeling structure. I show that discrete structured models can now be implemented efficiently on modern hardware with optimizing compilers. These approaches generalize the standard softmax function we all know and love, and in fact are not much harder to use in practice. To show the benefit of this approach, I will describe a factorization of the Transformer into a structured model that lets us learn a fast and accurate parallel translation decoder. The system shows how to take advantage of efficient inference based on basic distributional properties, while maintaining the modeling benefits of a deep model."

      abstract: "Machine learning systems are now easier to build than ever, but they still don’t
 perform as well as we would hope on real applications. I’ll explore a simple idea in this talk: if ML systems were more malleable and could be maintained like software, we might build better systems. I’ll discuss an immediate bottleneck towards building more
 malleable ML systems: the evaluation pipeline. I’ll describe the need for finer-grained performance measurement and monitoring, the opportunities paying attention to this area could open up in maintaining ML systems, and some of the tools that I’m building

      title: "Assorted boring problems in distributed machine learning"
      abstract: "Much of the academic focus on “distributing/scaling up machine learning” is synonymous with “training larger supervised ML models like GPT-3 with more and more compute resources”. However, training is only a small part of the ML lifecycle. In this talk, I’ll focus on a couple other machine learning problems that demand a large amount of compute resources, which may be a bit more “boring” but equally (or arguably more!) important. I’ll cover a couple problems that my collaborators and I have previously worked on at UC Berkeley and now at Anyscale: abstractions for scalable reinforcement learning and building RLlib (ICML 18, ICLR 20), distributed hyperparameter tuning and dynamic resource allocation for hyperparameter tuning (SOCC 19, Eurosys 21), and ray as a substrate for the next generation of ML platforms."

      title: "Deep Learning Based Recommender Systems in Production"
      abstract: "Recommender Systems are one of the most complex ML applications to deploy into production.  The data is sparse, massive, and constantly increasing, and the models deployed create a feedback loop that requires careful monitoring.  What's more, the hardware and software that led to the revolution of deep learning was built during the era of computer vision.  Differences in architecture and data between vision and recommenders initially made the HW/SW stack a poor fit for deep learning based recommender systems.  In this talk we'll explore what makes recommenders different from a data, architecture, and system perspective, and talk about changes in GPU hardware within the last generation that make it much better suited to the recommendation problem.  By focusing on these differences we've also identified improvements on the software side that take advantage of optimizations only possible in the recommendation domain.  A new era of faster ETL, Training and Inference is coming to the RecSys space and this talk will walk through some of the patterns of optimization that guide the tools we're building to make recommenders both faster to use and easier to deploy on GPUs."

      title: "Towards Instance-Optimized Data Systems"
      abstract: "Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around ML-enhanced (or learned) algorithm and data structures. For example, there has been work on applying machine learning to improve query optimization, indexing, storage layouts, scheduling, log-structured merge trees, sorting, compression, sketches, among many other things. Arguably, the motivation behind these techniques are similar: machine learning is used to model the data and/or workload in order to derive a more efficient algorithm or data structure. Ultimately, what these techniques will allow us to build are “instance-optimized” systems; systems that self-adjust to a given workload and data distribution to provide unprecedented performance and avoid the need for tuning by an administrator.
In this talk, I will provide an overview of the opportunities and limitations of learned index structures, storage layouts, and query optimization techniques we have been developing in my group, and how we are integrating these techniques to build a first instance-optimized database system."

      title: "Disruptive Research on Distributed ML Systems"
      abstract: "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) enable computers to excel across many different applications such as image classification, speech recognition and robotics control. To accelerate DNN training and serving, parallel computing is widely adopted. System efficiency is a big issue when scaling out. In this talk, I will make three arguments towards better system efficiency in distributed DNN training and serving.

First, Ring All-Reduce for model synchronization is not optimal, but Blink is. By packing spanning trees rather than forming rings, Blink achieves higher flexibility in arbitrary networking environments and provides near-optimal network throughput. Blink is filed as a US patent and is being used by Microsoft. Blink gains lots of attention from industry, such as Facebook (distributed PyTorch team), ByteDance (parent company of TikTok app). Blink was also featured on Nvidia GTC China 2019 and news from Baidu, Tencent.

Second, communication can be eliminated via sensAI's class parallelism. sensAI decouples a multi-task model into disconnected subnets, each is responsible for decision making of a single task. sensAI's attribute of low-latency, real-time model serving attracts several Venture Capitals in the Bay Area.

Third, Wavelet is more efficient than gang-scheduling. By intentionally adding task launching latency, Wavelet interleaves peak memory usage across different waves of training tasks on the accelerators, and thus it improves both computation and on-device memory utilization. Multiple companies, including Facebook and Apple, show interests to Wavelet project."

      abstract: "The past decade has witnessed a 300,000 times increase in the amount of compute for AI. The latest natural language processing model is fueled with over trillion parameters while the memory need of neural recommendation and ranking models has grown from hundreds of gigabyte to the terabyte scale. This talk introduces the underinvested deep learning personalization and recommendation systems in the overall research community. The training of state-of-the-art industry-scale personalization and recommendation models consumes the highest number of compute cycles among all deep learning use cases at Facebook. For AI inference, recommendation use cases consume even higher compute cycles of 80%. What are the key system challenges faced by industry-scale neural personalization and recommendation models? This talk will highlight recent advances on AI system development for deep learning recommendation and the implications on infrastructure optimization opportunities across the machine learning system stack.

      abstract: "The focus of this presentation is the scalable and distributed machine learning platform, H2O. The multi-node distributed algorithms (GLM, Random Forest, GBM, DNNs, etc) can train on datasets which are larger than RAM (of a single machine), and H2O integrates with other 'big data' systems, Hadoop and Spark. H2O is engineered for production use cases with a focus on fast training and prediction speeds. The second part of the talk will discuss a systems approach to developing novel machine learning algorithms such as H2O AutoML.  Unlike well-defined ML algorithms (e.g. GBM), an 'AutoML' algorithm is an automated process which aims to train the best model (or ensemble) in a specified amount of time.  I will discuss our methodology for experimentation and validation of new strategies or changes to the algorithm, using a benchmark-driven systems approach."

      title: "Building Decentralized Neural Search Systems in Production"
      abstract: "With the rapid growth of media and meta data in both the enterprise and consumer markets, there is an evolving need for search systems to go beyond simple symbolic retrieval and towards more cognitive-driven understanding. Today,  with the ever more long documents and  multimedia data, finding the right information is more important and challenging than ever. The rise of deep learning has ushered in a new era of neural search. However, building a neural search system is non-trivial for researchers and engineers. While neural search has long held a significant promise, the advantages of open source combined with recent advances in deep learning now provides us a framework to make the next generation of search technology a reality.

In this talk, I will describe how Jina solves these challenges by providing an open source neural search ecosystem for businesses and developers, allowing anyone to search any kind of data with high availability and scalability - driving the shift from a traditional search system to a state-of-the-art AI-centric search system."

      title: "NoisePage: The Self-Driving Database Management System"
      abstract: "Database management systems (DBMSs) are an important part of modern data-driven applications. However, they are notoriously difficult to deploy and administer. There are existing methods that recommend physical design or knob configurations for DBMSs. But most of them require humans to make final decisions and decide when to apply changes. The goal of a self-driving DBMS is to remove the DBMS administration impediments by managing itself autonomously. In this talk, I present the design of a new self-driving DBMS (NoisePage) that enables such automatic system management. I first discuss a forecasting framework that uses unsupervised clustering and ensemble ML models to efficiently predict the query arrival rates under varying database workload patterns. I then describe NoisePage's modeling framework that constructs and maintains ML models to predict the behavior of self-driving DBMS actions: the framework decomposes the DBMS architecture into fine-grained operating units to estimate the system's behavior under unseen configurations. I then introduce our ongoing work for an action planning framework that makes explainable decisions based on the forecasted workload and the modeled behavior. Lastly, I explain how we integrate all the self-driving components into the system."

      abstract: "Hand-crafted neural architecture design has played a major role in accelerating progress in computer vision, resulting in effective backbones like ResNet. Unfortunately, these convolutional backbones are not as effective in other domains. Successfully transferring existing architectures to applications such as sequence modeling, learning on graphs, or solving partial differential equations has required the manual design of task-specific neural operations to replace convolutions. In this talk, we will first motivate the problem of 'automating architecture transfer' to enable users to find the right operations given data from their specific domain. We will next present our ongoing work on this problem, by introducing a family of neural operations called 'XD-Operations' that mimic the inductive bias of multichannel convolutions while being much more expressive, provably containing numerous well-known operations. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of XD-operations on a diverse set of applications---in some cases outperforming the latest neural operation designs."
