      title: "JAX: accelerating machine learning research by composing function transformations in Python"
      abstract: "JAX is a system for high-performance machine learning research and numerical computing. It offers the familiarity of Python+NumPy together with hardware acceleration, plus a set of composable function transformations: automatic differentiation, automatic batching, end-to-end compilation (via XLA), parallelizing over multiple accelerators, and more. JAX's core strength is its guarantee that these user-wielded transformations can be composed arbitrarily, so that programmers can write math (e.g. a loss function) and transform it into pieces of an ML program (e.g. a vectorized, compiled, batch gradient function for that loss).

JAX had its open-source release in December 2018 (https://github.com/google/jax). It's used by researchers for a wide range of applications, from studying training dynamics of neural networks, to probabilistic programming, to scientific applications in physics and biology."

      title: "Scalable Bayesian Optimization for Industrial Applications"
      abstract: "Bayesian optimization has become a powerful method for the sample-efficient optimization of expensive black-box functions. These functions do not have a closed-form and are evaluated for example by running a complex economic simulation, by an experiment in the lab or in a market, or by a CFD simulation.  Use cases arise in machine learning, e.g., when tuning the configuration of an ML model or when optimizing a reinforcement learning policy.  Examples in engineering include the design of aerodynamic structures or materials discovery.
In this talk I will introduce the key ideas of Bayesian optimization and discuss how they can be applied to tuning ML models.  Moreover, I will share some experiences with developing a Bayesian optimization service in industry.

      date: 11/12/20
      title: "Principles of Good Machine Learning Systems Design"
      abstract: "This talk covers what it means to operationalize ML models. It starts by analyzing the difference between ML in research vs. in production, ML systems vs. traditional software, as well as myths about ML production.

It then goes over the principles of good ML systems design and introduces an iterative framework for ML systems design, from scoping the project, data management, model development, deployment, maintenance, to business analysis. It covers the differences between DataOps, ML Engineering, MLOps, and data science, and where each fits into the framework. It also discusses the main skills each stage requires, which can help companies in structuring their teams.

The talk ends with a survey of the ML production ecosystem, the economics of open source, and open-core businesses."
      bio: "Chip Huyen is an engineer who develops tools and best practices for machine learning production. She’s currently with Snorkel AI and she’ll be teaching Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford from January 2021. Previously, she was with Netflix, NVIDIA, Primer.

    - speaker: Alex Ratner
      date: 11/05/20
      title: "Programmatically Building & Managing Training Data with Snorkel"
      abstract: "One of the key bottlenecks in building machine learning systems is creating and managing the massive training datasets that today's models require. In this talk, I will describe our work on Snorkel (snorkel.org), an open-source framework for building and managing training datasets, and describe three key operators for letting users build and manipulate training datasets: labeling functions, for labeling unlabeled data; transformation functions, for expressing data augmentation strategies; and slicing functions, for partitioning and structuring training datasets.  These operators allow domain expert users to specify machine learning (ML) models entirely via noisy operators over training data, expressed as simple Python functions---or even via higher level NL or point-and-click interfaces---leading to applications that can be built in hours or days, rather than months or years, and that can be iteratively developed, modified, versioned, and audited. I will describe recent work on modeling the noise and imprecision inherent in these operators, and using these approaches to train ML models that solve real-world problems, including recent state-of-the-art results on benchmark tasks and real-world industry, government, and medical deployments."
      bio: "Alex Ratner is the co-founder and CEO of Snorkel AI, Inc., which supports the open source Snorkel library and develops Snorkel Flow, an end-to-end system for building machine learning applications, and an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Washington.  Prior to Snorkel AI and UW, he completed his PhD in CS advised by Christopher Ré at Stanford, where his research focused on applying data management and statistical learning techniques to emerging machine learning workflows, such as creating and managing training data, and applying this to real-world problems in medicine, knowledge base construction, and more."

    - speaker: Virginia Smith
      date: 10/29/20
      title: "On Heterogeneity in Federated Settings"
      abstract: "A defining characteristic of federated learning is the presence of heterogeneity, i.e., that data and compute may differ significantly across the network. In this talk I show that the challenge of heterogeneity pervades the machine learning process in federated settings, affecting issues such as optimization, modeling, and fairness. In terms of optimization, I discuss FedProx, a distributed optimization method that offers robustness to systems and statistical heterogeneity. I then explore the role that heterogeneity plays in delivering models that are accurate and fair to all users/devices in the network. Our work here extends classical ideas in multi-task learning and alpha-fairness to large-scale heterogeneous networks, enabling flexible, accurate, and fair federated learning."

      date: 10/22/20
      title: "Machine Learning at Industrial Scale: Lessons from the MLflow Project"
      abstract: "Although enterprise adoption of machine learning is still early on, many enterprises in all industries already have hundreds of internal ML applications. ML powers business processes with an impact of hundreds of millions of dollars in industrial IoT, finance, healthcare and retail. Building and operating these applications reliably requires infrastructure that is different from traditional software development, which has led to significant investment in the construction of “ML platforms” specifically designed to run ML applications. In this talk, I’ll discuss some of the common challenges in productionizing ML applications based on experience building MLflow, an open source ML platform started at Databricks. MLflow is now the most widely used open source project in this area, with over 2 million downloads a month and integrations with dozens of other products. I’ll also highlight some interesting problems users face that are not covered deeply in current ML systems research, such as the need for “hands-free” ML that can train thousands of independent models without direct tuning from the ML developer for regulatory reasons, and the impact of privacy and interpretability regulations on ML. All my examples will be based on experience at large Databricks / MLflow customers."
      bio: "Matei Zaharia is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and Chief Technologist at Databricks.

      date: 10/15/20
      title: "Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList"
      abstract: "We will present CheckList, a task-agnostic methodology and tool for testing NLP models inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering.\n
\n
We will show a lot of fun bugs we discovered with CheckList, both in commercial models (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) and research models (BERT, RoBERTA for sentiment analysis, QQP, SQuAD). We'll also present comparisons between CheckList and the status quo, in a case study at Microsoft and a user study with researchers and engineers. We show that CheckList is a really helpful process and tool for testing and finding bugs in NLP models, both for practitioners and researchers."
