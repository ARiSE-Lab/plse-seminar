We’re excited to be offering CS528, a seminar course at Stanford on the frontier of machine learning systems in Fall ‘21 with an all-star cast of invited speakers every week from industry and academia.

Machine learning is driving exciting changes and progress in computing. What does the ubiquity of machine learning mean for how people build and deploy systems and applications? What challenges does industry face when deploying machine learning systems in the real world, and how can academia rise to meet those challenges?

In this seminar series, we’ll take a look at the frontier of machine learning systems, and how machine learning changes the modern programming stack. Our goal is to curate a curriculum of awesome work in ML systems that helps drive research focus to interesting questions.

**Course Requirements**:
* In the first hour of class (Thursdays 1:30-2:30), students are expected to watch the [MLSys seminar series](index.md) live
* In the last half hour of class (Thursdays 2:30-3:00), students are expected to attend a private class discussion via zoom webinar with an invited guest expert in machine learning systems (often the same guest from the seminar)
* In addition, students will be asked to write a short (2-3 sentence) reflection every week about the week’s MLSys seminar

Up to two classes can be missed per quarter and watched non-live via YouTube recording.

Stanford students can sign up for the class **now**!
